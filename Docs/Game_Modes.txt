#### **Overview**: Campaign Mode offers a structured series of challenges that gradually introduce the game's mechanics, allowing players to unlock new cell types, behaviors, and environmental elements as they progress through the game.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Mission-Based Progression**: Players complete a series of missions with specific objectives, such as surviving a certain number of generations, defeating enemy species, or adapting to changing environmental conditions.
- **Unlockable Content**: Each mission completed unlocks new cells, behaviors, or environmental elements that players can use in future missions.

#### **Objectives**:
- **Evolutionary Survival**: Survive a set number of generations while adapting to evolving environmental hazards.
- **Resource Domination**: Control a percentage of resources on the map while competing against AI-controlled species.
- **Species Extinction**: Defeat or outlast AI-generated species in a controlled environment.

### **4.1.2 Survival Mode**

#### **Overview**: Survival Mode is a test of endurance where the player's species must adapt and thrive in an increasingly hostile environment. The goal is to last as long as possible while dealing with resource scarcity, environmental hazards, and evolving enemy species.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Endless Gameplay**: The game continues indefinitely until the player’s species is wiped out. As the game progresses, hazards become more frequent and aggressive species evolve.
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Environmental hazards, enemy species, and resource scarcity scale over time, forcing players to continuously adapt their species to survive.

#### **Objectives**:
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently gather resources and adapt to their depletion or changing locations.
- **Species Resilience**: Evolve traits that make the species resistant to environmental changes or enemy attacks.
- **Enemy Elimination**: Defeat or avoid increasingly aggressive enemy species that evolve alongside the player’s species.

#### **Win/Loss Conditions**:
- **Win**: There is no formal win condition; the goal is to survive as long as possible, with achievements or rewards for surpassing certain time thresholds.
- **Loss**: The game ends when the player's species becomes extinct due to resource depletion, environmental hazards, or enemy species.

### **4.1.3 Creative Mode**

#### **Overview**: Creative Mode removes survival constraints, allowing players to design and experiment with their species without worrying about resource limitations, hazards, or enemies. This mode is ideal for players who want to freely explore the game’s mechanics and species design system.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Unlimited Resources**: Players have access to an unlimited supply of resources, enabling them to design complex and large species without restriction.
- **No Hazards or Enemies**: Environmental hazards and AI enemies are disabled, allowing players to focus entirely on their species’ design and behaviors.

#### **Objectives**:
- **Experimentation**: Explore different cell combinations, behaviors, and evolutionary paths without pressure.
- **Custom Creations**: Build unique species and test their effectiveness in simulated environments.

#### **Win/Loss Conditions**:
- **No Formal End**: Creative Mode is a sandbox, with no victory or defeat. Players can exit at any time and save their creations for use in other game modes.

### **4.1.4 Challenge Mode**

#### **Overview**: Challenge Mode presents players with specific scenarios or constraints that force them to think strategically and creatively. These challenges are designed to test players' mastery of the game’s mechanics and reward them with unique achievements or unlocks.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Preset Scenarios**: Each challenge comes with predefined species, environmental conditions, or objectives. Players must work within these constraints to achieve the goal.
- **Timed Challenges**: Some challenges may have time limits, forcing players to adapt quickly and think on their feet.

#### **Example Challenges**:
- **Limited Resource Survival**: Survive for a set period with minimal resources.
- **Species Rescue**: Defend a weakened species from extinction by evolving it rapidly within a limited time frame.
- **Resource War**: Compete against an aggressive AI species to control a finite pool of resources.

#### **Win/Loss Conditions**:
- **Win**: Complete the objective within the given constraints or time limit.
- **Loss**: Failure to meet the challenge's objectives results in defeat.

## **4.2 Multiplayer Modes (Optional)**

Multiplayer modes in **EvolveSim** are designed to introduce both competitive and cooperative experiences where players can face off against or collaborate with other human players.

### **4.2.1 Competitive Matches**

#### **Overview**: In Competitive Matches, players face off against each other by designing their species and deploying them into a shared environment. The goal is to outlast and out-evolve your opponents.

#### **Key Features**:
- **PvP Combat**: Players must compete for resources and territory while engaging in direct combat with each other's species.
- **Dynamic Evolution**: As players evolve their species in response to one another, emergent strategies arise. Victory may depend on quick adaptation or long-term planning.

#### **Objectives**:
- **Territorial Control**: Secure key resource nodes and defend them against other players.
- **Species Domination**: Defeat opposing players by wiping out their species or forcing them into resource starvation.

#### **Win/Loss Conditions**:
- **Win**: Be the last species standing by eliminating all competitors or securing control of the majority of resources.
- **Loss**: Players lose when their species is completely eliminated or unable to sustain itself due to lack of resources.

### **4.2.2 Cooperative Play**

#### **Overview**: Cooperative Play allows players to team up and work together to survive against a shared environment or a set of AI-controlled enemy species. In this mode, players collaborate on resource gathering, species evolution, and territory defense.

#### **Key Features**:
- **Shared Species Pool**: Players can share resources, cells, or even evolve hybrid species to maximize their chances of survival.
- **Cooperative Strategy**: Players can divide responsibilities, with one focusing on offense, another on defense, and another on resource management, promoting teamwork and coordination.

#### **Objectives**:
- **Survival**: Work together to keep both species alive as long as possible against evolving environmental hazards and enemy species.
- **Resource Control**: Players must collaborate to efficiently gather resources and allocate them across both species.
- **Defensive Coordination**: Protect each other’s species from incoming threats and share knowledge to overcome environmental challenges.

#### **Win/Loss Conditions**:
- **Win**: Survive for a set period or outlast AI enemies.
- **Loss**: The game ends when both players’ species become extinct.
