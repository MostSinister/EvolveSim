#### **b. Hidden and Special Achievements** - **Exploration Achievements**: Unlock when players discover hidden game mechanics or environmental features, such as rare resource nodes or evolutionary triggers. - **Creative Achievements**: Awarded for unique species designs in Creative Mode, recognizing players who push the limits of the species editor to create unusual or highly effective organisms. - **Challenge Achievements**: Tied to completing specific scenarios in Challenge Mode, often with restricted resources or specific constraints, rewarding players who can think outside the box.

### **
**7.1**.3 Unlockable Content**

As players progress through **EvolveSim**, they unlock a wide range of new content, adding depth and complexity to the gameplay. This content includes new cell types, behaviors, environmental elements, and visual customization options.

#### **a. New Cell Types** - **Advanced Cells**: Unlock more specialized and powerful cell types, such as cells with enhanced offensive abilities, advanced healing capabilities, or energy regeneration properties. - **Environmental Adaptations**: Unlock cells that are particularly resistant to certain environmental hazards (e.g., acid-resistant cells, heat-resistant cells). - **Mutation-Specific Cells**: Gain access to cells that evolve in specific ways based on in-game mutations, offering unique advantages in survival or combat.

#### **b. Behaviors and Behavior Modifiers** - **Advanced Behaviors**: As players progress, they unlock new and more complex behaviors for their species, such as coordinated attacks, resource prioritization, and defensive formations. - **Behavior Modifiers**: Unlock behavior modifiers that allow players to fine-tune how their species reacts to specific stimuli, such as prioritizing certain resources, targeting weaker enemies, or retreating under certain conditions.

#### **c. Visual and Aesthetic Customizations** - **Cell Skins**: Unlock new visual designs for cells, allowing players to customize the appearance of their species with unique colors, patterns, and effects. - **Evolutionary Markers**: Unlock aesthetic indicators that highlight key evolutionary milestones in a species’ development (e.g., glowing cells, distinctive patterns that represent advanced mutations). - **Species Themes**: Unlock theme packs that apply to an entire species, giving it a distinct visual identity (e.g., bioluminescent species, armored species, ethereal species).

**7.2** Progression in Different Game Modes**

Different game modes in **EvolveSim** offer unique progression opportunities, with each mode emphasizing different aspects of gameplay and strategy.

### **
**7.2**.1 Campaign Mode Progression**

In **Campaign Mode**, players advance through a structured series of missions, with each mission introducing new mechanics, challenges, and species designs. As players progress, they unlock more complex cells, behaviors, and evolutionary paths.

- **Mission Rewards**: Completing missions in Campaign Mode grants specific rewards tied to the theme of the mission, such as new cell types that are well-suited to the challenges of the next mission. - **Branching Paths**: Some missions offer branching progression paths, allowing players to choose between different types of rewards (e.g., unlocking a powerful offensive cell versus unlocking a defensive evolution path).

### **
**7.2**.2 Survival Mode Progression**

In **Survival Mode**, progression is tied to how long the player’s species can endure in an increasingly hostile environment. The longer the species survives, the more points the player earns, which can be used to unlock new cells and behaviors.

- **Long-Term Survival Bonuses**: Players who achieve long survival times unlock permanent bonuses that carry over into other game modes. These bonuses might include increased energy efficiency, improved mutation rates, or more robust cells. - **Dynamic Challenges**: As players survive longer, the environment becomes more challenging, introducing new hazards and enemy species that force the player to adapt.

### **
**7.2**.3 Competitive and Cooperative Progression**

In multiplayer modes, players are rewarded for their performance in matches against other players or AI species. Progression in these modes focuses on strategic depth and team collaboration.

- **Ranking System**: Competitive multiplayer offers a ranking system, where players earn rank points based on their performance in matches. Higher-ranked players unlock exclusive cells, behaviors, and visual customization options. - **Cooperative Rewards**: In cooperative modes, players earn shared progression points for working together to achieve objectives, with bonuses for team-based strategies and coordination.

## **
**7.3** Evolutionary Progression**

**Evolutionary Progression** is a unique form of progression in **EvolveSim** that focuses on the development and refinement of the player’s species over multiple generations.

### **
**7.3**.1 Generational Evolution**

As players evolve their species, they can guide the direction of evolution across multiple generations, unlocking traits and mutations that persist through future matches.

- **Evolutionary Pathways**: Players can unlock specific evolutionary trees based on their species’ behaviors and environmental conditions. For example, species that focus on resource gathering may unlock specialized cells that enhance their ability to find and collect resources. - **Generational Traits**: Certain traits, such as improved energy efficiency or faster reproduction, carry over between matches, giving players a sense of continuity and progression as they experiment with new species designs.

### **
**7.3**.2 Mutation-Based Rewards**

The game’s mutation system rewards players for experimenting with different species designs and adapting to their environment. Players can unlock unique cells, behaviors, and visual effects based on the mutations that occur during gameplay.

- **Mutation Logs**: The game tracks all mutations that occur during a match, offering rewards for unlocking rare or particularly powerful mutations. - **Cross-Species Hybridization**: In some game modes, players can combine traits from different species, unlocking hybrid species that possess the strengths of multiple organisms.
