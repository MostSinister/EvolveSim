- **Resource Strategies**:   - **Resource Denial**: Focus on depleting resources to starve the player’s species.   - **Hoarding**: Accumulate resources rapidly to outpace the player’s growth.

#### **b. Interaction with Environmental Elements**

- **Hazard Utilization**:   - Enemies may use hazards to their advantage, luring player’s cells into danger.   - Some may be immune or resistant to certain hazards, exploiting areas the player avoids.

- **Environmental Manipulation**:   - Advanced enemies might alter the environment, such as creating barriers or deploying their own hazards.

#### **c. Cooperative Enemy Behavior**

- **Group Coordination**:   - Enemy cells coordinate actions for greater effectiveness.   - Behaviors like "Swarming" or "Pack Hunting" increase threat levels.

- **Communication Systems**:   - Enemies may have cells that signal others, calling for reinforcements or coordinating attacks.
