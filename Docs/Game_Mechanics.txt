## **2.1 Core Gameplay Loop**

The core gameplay loop of **EvolveSim** revolves around the creation, evolution, and survival of the player's species within a dynamic, continuous environment. The loop is designed to be engaging and cyclical, encouraging players to iteratively refine their species and strategies based on in-game outcomes.

### **Overview of the Core Loop**

1. **Species Creation**:
   - Players use the **Freeform Editor** to design their species by placing and connecting cells, assigning behaviors, and customizing attributes.
   - The editor allows for creative freedom, enabling unique and diverse species designs.

2. **Deployment into the Environment**:
   - Once the species is designed, players deploy it into the **Continuous Simulation Environment**.
   - The environment is populated with resources, hazards, and competing species.

3. **Simulation and Interaction**:
   - The species begins to interact with the environment and other entities based on the assigned behaviors and attributes.
   - The physics engine simulates realistic movements, collisions, and interactions.

4. **Resource Management and Survival**:
   - The species must gather resources to sustain itself, reproduce, and expand.
   - Avoiding or overcoming environmental hazards is crucial for survival.

5. **Competition and Evolution**:
   - The species encounters enemy species (pre-made or procedurally generated) and competes for resources and territory.
   - Through reproduction and mutation, the species can evolve, potentially developing new traits or behaviors.

6. **Outcome and Feedback**:
   - The game progresses until a victory or defeat condition is met (e.g., the species outcompetes others or becomes extinct).
   - Players receive feedback through in-game statistics, visual cues, and post-match summaries.

7. **Iteration and Refinement**:
   - Based on the outcomes and insights gained, players return to the editor to refine their species.
   - The loop repeats, allowing for continuous learning and experimentation.

### **Key Components of the Core Loop**

- **Creative Expression**: Empowering players to design and customize their species fosters engagement and personal investment.
- **Strategic Decision-Making**: Balancing attributes, behaviors, and resource management introduces strategic depth.
- **Emergent Gameplay**: Unpredictable interactions and evolution lead to unique experiences each playthrough.
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Providing clear and immediate feedback helps players understand the impact of their decisions.

### **Objectives within the Loop**

- **Survival**: Maintain the species' population by managing resources and adapting to challenges.
- **Dominance**: Outcompete enemy species by securing resources, evolving advantageous traits, and employing effective behaviors.
- **Exploration**: Discover new areas within the environment, uncovering resources or hazards.
- **Evolution**: Through reproduction and mutation, develop new traits that enhance survival and competitiveness.

### **Player Engagement Strategies**

- **Progression Systems**: Unlock new cells, behaviors, and attributes as rewards for achieving objectives.
- **Achievements and Milestones**: Recognize and reward significant accomplishments, encouraging continued play.
- **Dynamic Challenges**: Introduce variability through procedural generation, ensuring no two games are the same.

## **2.2 Freeform Editor**

The Freeform Editor is a cornerstone of **EvolveSim**, providing players with a powerful and intuitive tool to design their species. It allows for organic and unrestricted creation, fostering creativity and strategic planning.

### **2.2.1 Editor Interface Design**

#### **Layout and Navigation**

- **Main Canvas Area**:
   - A large, open canvas where players can place and manipulate cells freely.
   - Supports zooming and panning for detailed work and overview perspectives.

- **Tool Palette**:
   - Located on one side of the screen, containing tools for cell placement, selection, connection, and manipulation.
   - Includes icons for different cell types, behaviors, and attributes.

- **Properties Panel**:
   - Displays information about selected cells or groups.
   - Allows adjustment of attributes and behaviors through sliders, checkboxes, or input fields.

- **Preview Window**:
   - A small, optional area where players can test the species' behaviors in a controlled environment before deployment.

- **Resource Indicator**:
   - Shows available points or resources for species creation, updating in real-time as cells are added or modified.

- **Navigation Controls**:
   - Buttons or shortcuts for undo/redo, save, load, and reset.

#### **User Experience Considerations**

- **Intuitive Controls**:
   - Drag-and-drop mechanics for placing cells.
   - Keyboard shortcuts for frequently used actions.

- **Visual Feedback**:
   - Highlighting selected cells.
   - Real-time updates to attribute changes.

- **Accessibility**:
   - Clear icons and labels.
   - Tooltips providing descriptions and guidance.

- **Customization Options**:
   - Ability to change the editor's background grid, snap settings, or visual aids.

## **2.3 Continuous Simulation Environment**

The continuous simulation environment in **EvolveSim** is a dynamic space where players' created species interact, evolve, and compete against each other and the environment. This section outlines the key components and mechanics of the simulation, emphasizing the integration of physics, environmental elements, and the overall design philosophy that supports emergent gameplay.

### **2.3.1 Physics Integration**

To create a realistic and engaging simulation, we will utilize a physics engine that supports 2D physics interactions. The selected engine, such as **Matter.js**, will provide essential functionalities, including collision detection, movement dynamics, and response to forces. This integration will enable:

- **Realistic Movement**: Physics-driven movement allows cells to respond naturally to user input and environmental interactions.
- **Collision Dynamics**: Cells will collide with each other and the environment, enabling realistic behaviors such as bouncing, sticking, or being destroyed.
- **Force Application**: Cells can exert forces on one another, simulating predator-prey interactions, resource gathering, and defensive behaviors.

## **2.4 Resource Management**

Resource management is a critical component of **EvolveSim**, driving the survival and growth of the player's species. Effective resource management influences reproduction, evolution, and competitive advantage within the simulation environment.

### **2.4.1 Resource Types**

- **Energy (Food)**: The fundamental resource required for cell activities such as movement, reproduction, and healing.
- **Material Resources**: Used for building structures, enhancing cells, or unlocking advanced attributes.

## **2.5 Environmental Hazards**

Environmental hazards introduce challenges that require players to adapt their species and strategies. Hazards affect movement, health, and resource availability, adding depth to the simulation.

---

## **2.6 Enemy Species**

Enemy species serve as both obstacles and catalysts for emergent gameplay. They introduce competition, unpredictability, and strategic depth as players must adapt to various behaviors and tactics.

---

## **2.7 Victory and Defeat Conditions**

Establishing clear victory and defeat conditions provides players with objectives and a sense of progression. These conditions vary depending on the game mode and player choices.

### **2.7.1 Game Objectives**

- **Survival**: Keep the player's species alive for as long as possible.
- **Dominance**: Eliminate all enemy species to become the sole surviving species.
